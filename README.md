# LuminaNotes

LuminaNotes explores techniques for generative music and creative coding. It collects research notes alongside Python modules used for data preparation, model training and evaluation.

This repository aims to provide:

- Examples of data loaders and utilities for music datasets.
- Prototype transformer models under the `omniintent` package.
- Test suites to ensure reproducible experiments.

Large media assets are stored using Git LFS to keep the repository lightweight.
