# LuminaNotes

LuminaNotes explores techniques for generative music and creative coding. It collects research notes alongside Python modules used for data preparation, model training and evaluation.

This repository aims to provide:

- Examples of data loaders and utilities for music datasets.
- Prototype transformer models under the `omniintent` package.
- Test suites to ensure reproducible experiments.

Large media assets are stored using Git LFS to keep the repository lightweight.

## Directory Structure

- `Lumina/` – Existing notes and documentation.
- `src/` – Python source modules for Echoes and OmniIntent projects.
- `tests/` – Pytest suites and tokenizer specs.
- `data/` – Bundled data packages stored via Git LFS.
- `.github/workflows/` – Continuous integration configuration.

## Roadmap
- Sprint-05 - 15 new capsules & Morphology v0.6.
- Sprint-06 - Creative Pack v0.2 with micro-fiction chapter 1.
- Sprint-07 - OmniIntent real-sensor integration.
