# BeatBound Roadmap

This document outlines the initial phases for the BeatBound project.

1. **Folder structure** – establish the `beatbound/` directory with
   subfolders `playground/`, `models/`, `loops/` and `docs/`.
2. **Talk-Box demo** – implement a browser-based TalkBox in
   `playground/` that requests microphone access, analyses real-time
   formant slopes and drives a simple BiquadFilter chain. Includes
   start/stop controls and presets.
3. **Build script** – provide a `package.json` using Vite for a local
   development server and include Tone.js as a dependency.
4. **Docs & README** – document this plan and add quick-start steps in
   the repository README.
