This capsule blueprint is reserved for the upcoming Echoes release. It serves as a placeholder to ensure structural consistency across the Morphology system. When the actual capsule data arrives, this file will transform into a fully detailed description of the audio textures, transitions, and dynamic parameters.

Developers may use this template to experiment with formatting or link tasks ahead of time. While the words here do not reference any real sonic element, they mimic the tone and pacing expected in the final documentation. Each sentence is intentionally kept short and direct for ease of reading.

After Sprint-05, we will replace every line with an expressive explanation of frequency modulation, modulation indices, and rhythmic layering. Until then, treat these paragraphs as filler text with no interpretive meaning. They exist solely to maintain repository layout and to test automation hooks. Please remove them as soon as genuine content is ready. For reference.
